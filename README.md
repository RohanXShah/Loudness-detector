# Loudness-detector
A small but mighty loudness detector that listens so you do not have to. It tracks audio levels in real time, spots spikes, and helps you keep sound clean, controlled, and consistent. Perfect for anyone who cares about not blowing out speakers, ears, or recordings. Simple setup, fast feedback, and zero guesswork.
